# WeatherApp
Created by Kevin Chen and Alex Gentle for Professor Irfan's Principles of Programming Languages Class, Fall 2017.

WeatherApp is a simple Ruby on Rails project that enables users to find the weather at any given location and save previous searches. It allows for searching by city, state, address, or even notable monuments and landmarks. 

To find the weather at a given location, the user enters their name (no need for real name) and a location to search for.
We utilize the ruby gem "Weather-API" which is a gem wrapper for the Yahoo Weather API to search the location and save relevant weather details. We store the weather at the time of search, along with name, in a database. The site then displays the relevant weather information on the home screen, along with dynamic images that display depending on the weather search result!
